# iNotebook

iNotebook is a note-taking application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal notes in a secure and user-friendly environment. 

The project implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and manage their notes. 

## Project Overview

The main goal of **iNotebook** is to provide a secure platform where users can store their notes online and access them from any device. It is a full-stack application that handles the frontend and backend using modern web technologies.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication:** 
   - Users can sign up and log in securely using JWT-based authentication.
   - Each user has a personal account and can manage their own notes.

2. **Create, Edit, Delete Notes:**
   - Users can create new notes, edit existing ones, and delete notes that they no longer need.
   - Notes are stored in a MongoDB database and can be accessed securely.

3. **Secure Backend:**
   - The backend is built using Express.js and Node.js, with JWT tokens used to ensure that only authenticated users can access or manipulate the data.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database to store user data and notes.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework to handle API requests.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side operations.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for secure user authentication.

## Usage Flow

1. **Register/Login:** Users can create an account or log in to an existing account.
2. **Manage Notes:** After logging in, users can create, view, edit, and delete their personal notes.
3. **Secure Access:** All API requests are protected using JWT, ensuring that only authorized users can access their data.
